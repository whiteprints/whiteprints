"""Gather and organize runtime information for the current Python environment.

This module provides functionality to collect comprehensive debug details such
as operating system specifics, Python interpreter information, package
versioning, and dependency data. It is designed to facilitate troubleshooting
by generating a structured snapshot of the environment in which the code is
running.

The collected data includes:
    - OS distribution details (e.g., name, version).
    - Python version and platform information.
    - Package versions, including the version of this module.
    - A list of Python paths where modules are searched.
    - Detailed information about runtime dependencies, including their versions
      and locations when available.

This is useful for debugging issues related to dependency resolution,
environment configuration across different systems.
