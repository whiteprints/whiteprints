## How to set up your development environment

You simply need [uv] and a copy of the repository.

[uv]: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

To install python and setup your environment run

```console
uv python install
uv sync --all-extras
```

You can now run an interactive Python session:

```console
uv run python
```

If you whish to use a specific Python version you can use

```console
uv python pin ...
```

Please see [uv]'s documentation for more advanced usage.

## How to test the project

The test suite is managed by [Tox].

Run the full test suite:

```console
uvx tox run
```

List the available [Tox] sessions:

```console
uvx tox list
```

You can also run a specific [Tox] session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
uvx tox run -m test
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

[pytest]: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/
[Tox]: https://tox.wiki/en/stable/

Please see [Tox]'s documentation for more advanced usage.

## How to submit changes

Create a new [Git] branch to submit changes to this project.

```console
git switch -c my-contribution
```

Then commit and push your modifications on your branch.

Your contribution needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

  - The [Tox] test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
  - Include unit tests; this project maintains [100% code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/whiteprints/whiteprints).
  - If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, though we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your changes, you
can install [pre-commit] as a [Git hook] by running:

```console
uvx pre-commit install
```

Please ensure that your contribution is resolving a known [issue]. If not,
please create an associated [issue] first.

Once your code and your issue are ready, create a [GitHub] [Pull Request]
containing your modification and referencing the associated [issue].

If you don't know or are not sure on how to create a Pull Request, follow
the tutorial [creating a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
