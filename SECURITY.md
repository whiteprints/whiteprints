# 🔐 Security Policy

Vulnerabilities can be reported by sending an encrypted email to a [core member]
or using **[GitHub draft security advisory](https://github.com/whiteprints/whiteprints/security/advisories/new)** (recommended).

**Do not raise a public issue.**

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with
reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the
maintainers address the issue faster. If you are able, you may also include a
fix for the issue generated with git format-patch.
