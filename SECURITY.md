Vulnerabilities can be reported by sending an encrypted email to a [core member].

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with
reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the
maintainers address the issue faster. If you are able, you may also include a
fix for the issue generated with git format-patch.
