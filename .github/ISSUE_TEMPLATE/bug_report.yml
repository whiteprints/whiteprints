        If relevant, add a minimal example so that we can reproduce the error by running the code. It is very important for the snippet to be as succinct (minimal) as possible, so please take time to trim down any irrelevant code to help us debug efficiently. We are going to copy-paste your code and we expect to get the same result as you did: avoid any external data, and include the relevant imports, etc.

        You can place your example in triple quotes for better formatting. For example for a shell script:

        ```sh
        whiteprints init my_awesome_project
        ```
        Or for Python script:

        ```python
        from whiteprints import __version__

        print(__version__)
        ```

        You can use the preview button to visualize the code before submitting the issue.
